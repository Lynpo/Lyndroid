         * Every FlutterActivity creates its own FlutterEngine by default. Each FlutterEngine has a non-trivial warm-up time.
         * This means that launching a standard FlutterActivity comes with a brief delay before your Flutter experience
         * becomes visible. To minimize this delay, you can warm up a FlutterEngine before arriving at your FlutterActivity,
         * and then you can use your pre-warmed FlutterEngine instead.
         *
         * Note: When using a cached FlutterEngine, that FlutterEngine outlives any FlutterActivity
         * or FlutterFragment that displays it. Keep in mind that Dart code begins executing as soon
         * as you pre-warm the FlutterEngine, and continues executing after the destruction of your
         * FlutterActivity/FlutterFragment. To stop executing and clear resources, obtain your
         * FlutterEngine from the FlutterEngineCache and destroy the FlutterEngine with
         * FlutterEngine.destroy().

         * the same ID to any FlutterActivity or FlutterFragment that should use the cached FlutterEngine.
         * Using FlutterActivity with a cached FlutterEngine is discussed next.
         *
         * Note: Runtime performance isnâ€™t the only reason that you might pre-warm and cache a
         * FlutterEngine. A pre-warmed FlutterEngine executes Dart code independent from a
         * FlutterActivity, which allows such a FlutterEngine to be used to execute arbitrary Dart
         * code at any moment. Non-UI application logic can be executed in a FlutterEngine, like
         * networking and data caching, and in background behavior within a Service or elsewhere.
         * When using a FlutterEngine to execute behavior in the background, be sure to adhere to
         * all Android restrictions on background execution.
